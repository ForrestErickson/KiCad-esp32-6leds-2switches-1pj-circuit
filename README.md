## Facts

* I understand the function of a decoupling resistor.
* I comprehend the rationale behind including a voltage regulator circuit.
* ESP32 input pins require a pull-up resistor.
* It's necessary to include a power flag next to your GND and Vin connections in the KiCad schematic.
* The ESP32 antenna should be positioned at the edge of the PCB.
* The anular ring between the inner and outer diameters of the through holes in the ESP32 footprint is 0.7 mm.
* the pins of the Esp32 are numberred counter clockwise

## Do Not Tell

* I've made errors.
* Engineers and spelling are not bestfriends.
* I was about to distroy the universe but my ESP32 was not strong enough.

## Did You Know? 

In propositional logic and Boolean algebra, De Morgan's laws, AKA De Morgan's theorem,  
are a pair of transformation rules that are both valid rules of inference.  
The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation.
Named after Augustus De Morgan, a 19th-century British mathematician.

## Credits
I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of several platforms. Firstly, GitHub, for its project management features, issues tracking, and project board, which have consistently proven useful during our usage. Additionally, I extend my thanks to KiCAD for providing the tools necessary for schematic capture and PCB design. I also appreciate the inventors and developers of the Arduino ecosystem, whose tools and hardware have had a profoundly positive impact on many individuals.

Furthermore, I am grateful for the Public Invention platform, which has facilitated communication and collaboration. Special recognition goes to my exceptional mentors, Mr. Forrest Lee Ereckson and Mr. Robert Reed. Their guidance has been invaluable in navigating these projects, fostering skill development, and providing ongoing support. Their mentorship has empowered me to apply my knowledge to projects that benefit public invention.
